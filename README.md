# findPath-RandomDFS  
-- Creates a square grid of input size n with start node at positionn [0, 0] {green} and goal position [n-1, n-1] {red}.  
-- Create or delete walls inside of grid by pressing the white and black squares.  
-- Display path by pressing start/green square.  
-- The path is a random path (i.e. not optimal) generated from randomised depth-first search.  
-- Commenting the line {Collections.shuffle(G.adjacency(v));} in Search.dfs() method will remove the randomness and generate a depth-first search path.
